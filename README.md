Related to 42: https://github.com/marsrobertson/one-life-true-self/issues/42 From my own personal perspective, a moment of reflection, genuine question: to what extent athletic physique matters? I've been doing sports for a while and my latest lady is a circus artist with unique physique... Add to the mix the Instagram algorightm and unrealistic standard of beauty? I may as well become a content creator myself, trying various approaches, including Only Fans account: https://onlyfans.com/marshavingfun

> 🇬🇧 London. Computer nerd.
> Decent connection with my body, clearly above the average. Enjoys flirting (you've been warned) with fit / strong / athletic ladies, sweat is sexy. At least 1 pull-up as a bar of entry to my club 💪
> Sensual consensual sapiosexual - attracted to intelligence and loads of other things, not necessarily nudity, tease my 🧠 please.
> You can also share your business secrets with me, what happens in bed stays in bed.

Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!

Demo images** courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
you can use for pretty much whatever.

PS: Delete index-demo.html and assets/js/demo.js when you're done messing with the demo
as neither are needed in production :)
